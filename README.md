# BinaryTree
##Created for the Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com/)

Unfortunately, this one does not have an interface, it simply is/has the classes and code in place.
It's a Binary Tree, or my take on how a binary tree could be built following the requirements placed upon by the Odin Project
in the "Ruby Programming" section.
